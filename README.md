# Kernel_Ridge_Regression
We study the performance of centered kernel ridge regression in the high dimensional setting where both the sample size and the data dimension grow large. The analysis is useful as it permits to jointly optimize the ridge parameter and the choice of the kernel.  
The codes are useful to reproduce results for our paper: 
# Risk Convergence of Centered Kernel Ridge Regression with Large Dimensional Data
in collaboration with Abla Kammoun, Xiangliang Zhang, Tareq Al-Naffouri and Mohamed-Slim Alouini.
